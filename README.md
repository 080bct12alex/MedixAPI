# 🧠 Patient Management System API (FastAPI Learning Project)

This is a beginner-friendly project designed to learn how to build RESTful APIs using **FastAPI**. It simulates a real-world use case of managing patient health records, including BMI calculations and automatic health verdicts. Data is stored in a local JSON file (`patients.json`).


📌 This project is ideal for those transitioning from **Flask to FastAPI**, or learning modern Python API development.
